      "# Introduction\n",
      "This document provides an overview of the Python Flask application with a MongoDB database. It covers the application architecture, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Application Architecture\n",
      "The application consists of two main components: the Python Flask web framework and the MongoDB database. The Flask framework is used to create the web application, while MongoDB is used to store and retrieve data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The application is written in Python and uses the Flask web framework. It is designed to run on a Linux server. The application code is organized into modules and classes, and is written using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "The application uses MongoDB as its database. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is optimized for storing and retrieving large amounts of data. It is designed to scale horizontally, meaning that it can easily be scaled up to handle larger amounts of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Installation Instructions\n",
      "1. Install Python 3.6 or higher.\n",
      "2. Install the Flask web framework.\n",
      "3. Install the MongoDB database.\n",
      "4. Download the application code from the repository.\n",
      "5. Create a virtual environment for the application.\n",
      "6. Install the required packages for the application.\n",
      "7. Configure the application settings.\n",
      "8. Run the application.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Usage Guidelines\n",
      "1. Access the application by navigating to the URL provided in the configuration file.\n",
      "2. Use the application's user interface to perform the desired operations.\n",
      "3. Use the MongoDB database to store and retrieve data.\n",
      "4. When finished, close the application.\n"

      "Before we begin, you need to have the following:\n",

      "Pymongo Python module installed on your machine\n",

      "\n",
      "What is Flask?\n",
      "Flask is a micro web application framework written in Python. It is lightweight and has a small set of dependencies. Flask is used to build web applications and APIs rapidly.\n",

      "\n",
      "Building a Python Flask Application with MongoDB:\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 1: Install Flask and Pymongo\n",
      "To install the Flask and Pymongo modules, open your command prompt or terminal and run the following commands:\n",

      "pip install flask\n",
      "pip install pymongo\n",

      "Start the MongoDB service\n",
      "Create a new database and collection\n",

      "\n",
      "Step 4: Create Flask routes to interact with MongoDB\n",
      "Now that we have our Flask app connected to our MongoDB database, we can create Flask routes to interact with the database. Here's how you can create a Flask route:\n",

      "@app.route('/')\n",

      "    myCollection = mongo.db.myCollection\n",
      "    documents = myCollection.find({})\n",
      "    return documents\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, we created a Flask route for the \"/\" endpoint. We created a new variable called myCollection and set it to the \"myCollection\" collection in our MongoDB database. We then retrieved all the documents in the collection using the find() method, and returned them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 5: Run your Flask application\n",
      "To run your Flask application, save your code in a new file called app.py and run the following command in your command prompt or terminal:\n",
